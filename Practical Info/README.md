<h1>Brief announcement : Using GitLab Team-Firewall</h1>

For the proper functioning of this team, we still need to make some arrangements. Good agreements, make good colleagues.
First of all make use of Issues, clearly state what needs to be done. The idea is not for everyone to just start assigning some issues to team members. This would only create chaos. You can, of course, assign them to yourself. You can also take an issue that you did not create. When you are done with your issue/task place it in the column Review::First. No issue should go straight to Done. This is to detect possible errors quickly. When you create an issue also use Labels (explained further below). An issue can also be done by several people as you can see at the beginning of this project where I gave everyone the task of looking up information (by a certain time). The time of the sprint (not the same as the time seen in your issue) can be seen in the Milestones. Be sure to consult : https://docs.gitlab.com/ or https://www.youtube.com for more stuff..


<h2>Section Labels</h2>

<h3>Administration labels</h3>

Labels labeled administration relate to administrative tasks. 

Some parameters are included : 
-     General (General administrative tasks);
-     Review (Draft or Final files need to be reviewed);
-     Draft (Draft works should always be refactored and reviewed before they are moved into the final folder);
-     Final(These are the final works , these have already been refactored. If these are still be modified they should be reviewed again);




<h3>Development labels</h3>

All things related to programming both in the backend and frontend are given one of these labels.


<h3>Priority labels</h3> 

Priority labels are labels that reflect a degree of urgency. The weight is given as a number (1-3), with a low number having a higher priority.


<h3>Review label(don't use)</h3>

The label review is a label as a name for a board in the team board.


<h2>Folder hierarchy</h2>

<h3>Folder Code</h3>

Anything to do with programming come here.

<h3>Folder Documents</h3> 

This folder contains only information that comes from the internet/books. Things you looked up that may be important to this project. You create a brief summary about the topic you researched. You be sure to mention the web link or book. 

<b>[- Highly important -]</b> : 

Everything you add new, comes in drafts. When drafts are refactored, they must be reviewed before being moved to final (info). This also applies to files in the final(info), if they also need to be modified they must be reviewed first before putting them away in the final folder.

<h3>Folder Reports</h3>

All the reports we have to do for the subject project. 

<b> [- Highly important -]</b> : 

Everything you add new, comes in drafts. When drafts are refactored, they must be reviewed before being moved to final (Final Reports). This also applies to files in the final(info), if they also need to be modified they must be reviewed first before putting them away in the final folder.

<h3>Folder VM</h3> 

Anything to do with the virtual machines. These could be configuration or log files. 


<h2>Recap</h2> 

1. Folder documents contains only info that you looked up on the internet/book. 
2. Folder Code contains only code.
3. Folder Reports contains only technical reports.
4. Folder VM contains only things related to the matrix (the Virtual-Machine).
