ways malware can get access to a network

- phishing mails with embedded links
- malicious websites

these are common ways for how viruses or other infected files(see below) can get into a network, this happens when a user download something that they may think is not a hazard to their computer or network of devices but in fact contain malicious code that can have major consequences


- via infected files

examples are extra pieces of code put into legitimate applications(executables), or documents (like macros in word or excel documents that run as soon as the document is opened), this could even be something that exists but only activates if/when another piece of code also exists on your computer, this way the malware can stay dormant until a better opportunity arises

- errors in the operating system

this is a form of attack that can be utilized by hackers or worms (a type of malware that attempts to spread itself without user interaction), these kinds of attacks are possible because of configuration errors by the user/network administrator or because of a mistake in the operating system itself, as these are so complex that not everything is safe 

- connected devices

it is possible for a fairly benign device to contain malware as well, an example would be a planted usb drive, that upon being plugged in automatically runs the script stored on it, this could be a script to give the other party access to your computer or a malware stager(see below)

- drive by download

this is a way of getting malware on your system from a website that automatically downloads files when you try to access it, this usually occurs via ads or popups that redirect you to these compromised websites, a good adblocker should do a lot of work here


what is a malware stager
a malware stager is a piece of code that on it's own will not cause any major harm to a computer system but is capable of installing other malware on your system instead, usually these files contain multiple layers of obfuscation to make it harder for antivirus software to detect what the code does
